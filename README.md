# Find MAC addresses
A handy script that I wrote to parse .pcap file for MAC addresses

Usage `python parse_pcap.py <file.pcap>` will give you a .txt file with it's vendors (if found)

To plot a graph use `python make_chart.py <file.txt>`

Note: This script is designed to work only with WLAN packets
